# Introduction

Ecuador is a middle income country located in upper South America next to Colombia and Peru. After its full dollarization in 2000, the country saw an economic surge between 2007-2014 as a result of high oil prices and a relatively indebted government [@Weisbrot.2017]. However, after a sharp decline in oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic, the country seems to be unable to return to its pre-pandemic or pre-2014 levels, with employment indicators at an all-time low.
