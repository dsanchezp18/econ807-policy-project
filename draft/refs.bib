@article{Bruhn.2012,
 abstract = {Levels of development vary widely within countries in the Americas. We argue that part of this variation has its roots in the colonial era, when colonizers engaged in different economic activities in different regions of a country. We present evidence consistent with the view that ``bad'' activities (those that depended heavily on labor exploitation) led to lower economic development today than ``good'' activities (those that did not rely on labor exploitation). Our results also suggest that differences in political representation (but not in income inequality or human capital) could be the intermediating factor between colonial activities and current development.},

@article{Glaeser.2004,
 abstract = {We revisit the debate over whether political institutions cause economic growth, or whether, alternatively, growth and human capital accumulation lead to institutional improvement. We find that most indicators of institutional quality used to establish the proposition that institutions cause growth are constructed to be conceptually unsuitable for that purpose. We also find that some of the instrumental variable techniques used in the literature are flawed. Basic OLS results, as well as a variety of additional evidence, suggest that (a) human capital is a more basic source of growth than are the institutions, (b) poor countries get out of poverty through good policies, often pursued by dictators, and (c) subsequently improve their political institutions.},

@article{Leyva.2020,
 abstract = {We ask how labor regulation and informality affect macroeconomic volatility and the propagation of shocks in emerging economies. For this, we propose a small open economy business cycle model with frictional labor markets, endogenous labor participation, and an informal sector. Our own calculations from the ENOE national household survey reveal that these three margins are important to account for the labor market dynamics in Mexico. The model is calibrated to the Mexican economy, in particular to business cycle moments for employment and informality. We show that interest rate shocks, which affect specifically job creation in the formal sector, are key to obtain a countercyclical informality rate. In our model, the presence of an informal sector might help to mitigate the impact of a stringent labor regulation on employment and consumption fluctuations. In that sense, it adds flexibility to the economy in its adjustment to shocks, but at the cost of a lower productivity and an excess TFP and output volatility. Reducing the burden of labor regulation to the formal sector might achieve the goal of reducing output volatility while improving at the same time the efficiency in the allocation of resources.},

@article{MacIsaac.1997,
 abstract = {Ecuadorian labor costs are said to be high because of the existence of many mandated benefits. Using the 1994 Living Standards Measurement Survey, we show that the effect of these benefits is actually mitigated by a reduction of base earnings, that is, of the foundation on which they are paid. The reduction is larger in the private than in the public sector and is negligible for unionized workers. We also show that, in spite of mandated benefits, interindustry wage differentials are comparable to those of Bolivia, a country characterized by ``flexible'' labor markets but otherwise similar to Ecuador.},

@article{MauricioPrado.2011,
 abstract = {The paper quantitatively investigates, in general equilibrium, the interaction between the firms' choice to operate in the formal or the informal sector and government policy on taxation and enforcement, given a level of regulation. A static version of Ghironi and Melitz's (2005) industry model is used to show that firms with lower productivity endogenously choose to operate in the informal sector. I use cross-country data on taxes, measures of informality, and measures of regulation (entry and compliance costs, red tape, etc.) to back out how high the enforcement levels must be country by country to make the theory match the data. The welfare gains from policy reforms are on average 1.2{\%} (measured in terms of consumption) for OECD countries. I also find that the welfare gains from reducing regulation are on average 2.1{\%}. Finally, performing a similar decomposition to that of Hall and Jones (1999), I find that distortions associated with informality account for a factor of 1.5 of the output per capita difference between the richest and the poorest countries.},

@article{Sassen.1994,
 abstract = {At the margin of the regulated economy lies another economy, in which activity goes unlicensed, unregulated, and untaxed, and whose participants often go overlooked by legal scholars and policy makers. The Yale Law Journal held a symposium on the informal economy to promote discussion among economists, sociologists, anthropologists, and legal scholars to advance understanding of the informal economy. The following papers were presented at the Yale Law School in March 1994. Regina Austin presents the example of urban street vending to illustrate how expanding the black public sphere will require that blacks defy a legal system that has effectively foreclosed them from the realm of production and commerce. Edgar Cahn, founder and president of the Time Dollar Network, argues that the paradigm of legal service is at odds with the dictates of the market economy and its underlying work ethic. He proposes a solution to the growing crisis in legal services that permits both the fulfillment of its original goals and the effective use of a significant, and as yet untapped, resource: exchange of Time Dollars. Time Dollars serve as a medium for trading time spent rendering public service for the receipt of legal services. Time Dollar networks facilitate the integration of otherwise marginalized and neglected people into a system that promotes feelings of productivity, community, and reciprocity. Richard Epstein explores the relationship between one's approach to the underground economy and one's belief about what conduct should be legal. He discusses the link between people's views of a law's fairness and their propensity to obey the law, noting that if those who bear the law's burdens view it as unfair, the fabric of voluntary compliance will unravel. Epstein surveys six case studies of the underground economy: public streets and sidewalks; eagle feathers and elephant tusks; pollution regulation; taxation; rent control and minimum wage laws; and illegal drugs. Lora Jo Foo examines the underground economy in {\textquotedbl}sweatshop{\textquotedbl} industries, particularly garment-making. She argues for stronger labor laws and stiffer penalties so that the profitability of violating the law disappears. She also advocates the creation of private rights of action to augment state enforcement of federal minimum wage and maximum hour laws. Arthur Jacobson introduces a jurisprudential distinction between the normative structures operating in the {\textquotedbl}static jurisprudence{\textquotedbl} of the formal economy and {\textquotedbl}dynamic jurisprudence{\textquotedbl} of the informal economy. The distinction between the two jurisprudences leads to disparate conceptions of norms and discordant expectations of the role of legality in social life. However, he argues, substantial interplay occurs between the two regimes. Morton Paglin shows how a misplaced reliance on households' reported income distorts governmental assessments of the underground economy in the United States. He proposes a solution that incorporates households' reported expenditures and shows how this information can be used to formulate more rational macroeconomics and poverty policies. George Priest critically examines moral judgments about the underground economy and shows that the broader condemnation of underground activity now conventional in modern discussion is highly problematic and cannot be defended. He compares the relative moral position of market-based to state-controlled regulatory activities and shows, through the example of the underground economy, how the market achieves with greater systematic success many democratic values often asserted as justifications for broader governmental regulation. Saskia Sassen challenges the conventional wisdom that informal economies are caused by increased, often illegal, immigrant labor. She argues that the informal economy is a result, primarily, of systemic factors characteristic of advanced capitalist urban societies. These factors include the decline of the middle class as the principal engine of economic growth and increased competition for land and other factors of production among businesses with widely varying profit making capabilities. Christian Zlolniski presents his empirical study of immigrant labor in the Silicon Valley. He explores the relationship between urban poverty and two types of labor in the informal sector: subcontracting of unskilled labor and small-scale vending. He concludes that policy-makers must consider alternative approaches to the regulation of this significant, but all to invisible, labor market.},
